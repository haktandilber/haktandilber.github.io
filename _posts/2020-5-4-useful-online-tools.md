title: Useful online tools that I frequently use
---

In this post I will mention some convinient websites I use while working on projects, documents etc.

- [Diagram Editor](https://diagrameditor.com) 

Most of the online diagram editors on the web are not free. And most of the free sites are either really basic or require memberships. This one works well for me because it has good tools for making UML charts. 

- [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com)

If you want to create good looking documents in LaTeX but don't want to deal with installing it on your computer and deal with libraries Overleaf is a great site for you. It's great for creating project reports, letters, CVs. There are some templates you can use and modify or you can start a document from scratch. There are some paid subscriptions on the site. But if you don't need collabaration features free version is more than enough. 

- [SmallPDF](https://smallpdf.com)

This site has a lot of features to modify, transform, convert PDF files. I frequently use the PDF to Excel feature to be able to interact with the tables on PDF files. I also find the merge PDF files pretty useful. There are paid subscriptions for additional features

- [waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/index.html)

An image upscaling site that uses AI. Primarily made for digital anime style art. But it also works pretty good on photos. It supports upscaling upto 2x and has noise reduction options aswell. You can find this projects Github repository [here.](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x)

- [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com)

I think this one is well-known but it is a really useful site for sending files. On free version you can send files upto 2GB. A user-friendly cool site.

- [Lorem Ipsum](https://lipsum.com)

A cool looking Latin dummy-text creator. Great for placing temporary text on websites, applications to see how it would look.
